> An API server using @augu/lilith

Without some of the code from [`auguwu/hana`](https://github.com/auguwu/hana) I would've given up on this project.

## Setup

- Rename the `config.example.json` file to `config.json`
- Fill it out
- Done!

Now go to the `central` directory and follow the instructions there!
